# coulombCalc
A program designed to calculate electric fields from systems of point charges, dipoles, spheres, shells, disks, rods, etc. using Coulomb's law.  The program graphs the
final electric field vector and outputs total electric field to the user.  A UI system is in progress but currently the project exists without one.
